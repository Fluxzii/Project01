I need to add comments still. This currently works good with main file excepted I ran it with everything commented out past 

bsd.sort(&petDatabaseSortableByName);
cout<<"*********************** After Sorting By Name Ascending"<<endl;
petDatabaseSortableByName.DisplayRecords();


Everything should be similar to to PetDatabaseSortableByXXXX for the rest of the sortable files. Worked on the search one a little 
bit but I need to work on some other stuff right now. Also don't know if we need PetDatabaseSortable.h and
PetDatabaseSearchable.h but I think it will make it super easy to implement SortableByName, SearchableByName, etc...
